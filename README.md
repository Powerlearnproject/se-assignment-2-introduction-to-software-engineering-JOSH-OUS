This comprehensive requirements engineering process helps avoid costly compliance issues and ensures the software delivers value to both the bank and its customers.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity refers to the practice of dividing a software system into separate, self-contained units called modules. Each module is designed to perform a specific function or a set of related functions and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently of the others.

Key Characteristics of Modularity:

    Cohesion: Each module should have a single, well-defined purpose or responsibility.
    Coupling: Modules should have minimal dependencies on each other, reducing the risk of changes in one module affecting others.
    Encapsulation: Implementation details of a module are hidden from other modules, exposing only necessary interfaces.

Benefits of Modularity:

    Improved Maintainability:
        Isolation of Issues: Bugs can be isolated and fixed within individual modules without impacting the entire system.
        Easier Updates: Enhancements or changes can be made to specific modules without needing to modify the entire codebase.
        Simplified Testing: Modules can be tested independently, making it easier to identify and correct errors.

    Enhanced Scalability:
        Parallel Development: Multiple teams can work on different modules simultaneously, accelerating development.
        Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects or parts of the same project, reducing redundancy.
        Incremental Growth: New features can be added by developing new modules or extending existing ones, without major restructuring.

Example:
Consider an e-commerce application:

    User Management Module: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
    Product Catalog Module: Manages product listings, categories, and search functionality.
    Order Processing Module: Deals with cart management, order placement, and payment processing.

By designing these functionalities as separate modules, developers can update the order processing system without affecting user management or the product catalog, thus maintaining stability and allowing for easier scalability.
